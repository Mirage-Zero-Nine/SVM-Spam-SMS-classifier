# SVM-Spam-SMS-classifier

## Introduction
This repo is an implementation of SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. And a Naive Bayes classifier is included as a comparison, too. 

This classifier contains the model training process, hence it will take some time to train the model for classification.

## Environment
1. Python 3.6
2. `Numpy`
3. `Sklearn`

## How to test it?
Run the `classifier_main.py` in terminal. The training process and test process will start automatically. The statistics will be shown after whole process is completed.

## Data source
There are two databases contains in this repo. One is UCI machine learning database, marked as `ham` and `spam` in repo. The other one is Lingspam and marked as `ham1` and `spam1`.
